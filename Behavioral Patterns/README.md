# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

1. [**Chain of Responsibility**](Chain of Responsibility/) - Lets you pass requests along a chain of handler object. Each handler can then decide to process the request, or pass it to the next in the chain.

2. [**Command**](Command/) - Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.

3. **Iterator** - *Coming Soon!*

4. **Mediator** - *Coming Soon!*

5. **Memento** - *Coming Soon!*

6. [**Observer**](Observer/) - Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

7. [**State Pattern**](State/) - Similar to a Finite-State machine. Lets and object alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

8. [**Strategy **](Strategy/)- Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

9. **Template Method** - *Coming Soon!*

10. **Visitor** - *Coming Soon!*
