# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

1. [**Chain of Responsibility**](Chain of Responsibility/) - Lets you pass requests along a chain of handler object. Each handler can then decide to process the request, or pass it to the next in the chain.

2. **Command** - *Coming Soon!*

3. **Iterator** - *Coming Soon!*

4. **Mediator** - *Coming Soon!*

5. **Memento** - *Coming Soon!*

6. **Observer** - *Coming Soon!*

7. [**State Pattern**](State/) - Similar to a Finite-State machine. Lets and object alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

    

8. **Strategy **- *Coming Soon!*

9. **Template Method** - *Coming Soon!*

10. **Visitor** - *Coming Soon!*
